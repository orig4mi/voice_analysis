Perturbation analysis of voice based on: H. Herzel, D. Berry, I. R. Titze, 
& M. Saleh,  "Analysis of vocal disorders with methods from nonlinear 
dynamics", Journal of Speech and Hearing Research 37, 1008-1019, 1994.

If you run it with an old version of Matlab, you will need to use 
wavread instead of audioread in line 22.

Comments are always welcome.
